					As defined by Wikipedia,
					“Political economy is the study of production and trade and their relations with law,
					custom and government; and with the distribution of national income and wealth”. Thus, in simple
					terms, it
					studies
					the interaction between corporates (actors involved in production and trade), government, and
					bureaucrats
					(responsible for law, custom, and governance). Among the influential actors who are somehow involved
					in the
					policy
					making process, or are involved in the policy discourse, we include actors like politicians,
					business-persons,
					bureaucrats, social activists, academics, policy experts, and judiciary members. We call these
					influential
					actors
					elites, and study what they speak about and how they speak about, with respect to a policy.
					<br><br>
					On clicking a particular
					event, we can see which entities or entity groups were more vocal in mass media (entity
					coverage) in terms of the statements they made about a policy, and the aggregate sentiment slant of
					their
					statements
					about a policy. This analysis is done across all of the seven newspapers considered in the media
					space.

									areas with high-speed Internet networks. The underlying assumption is that easier
									and
									cheaper access to the Internet will lead to development of the poor, but many
									researchers have argued that such an infrastructure push should also be accompanied
									by a
									digital literacy campaign to alert first-time users of information technology about
									problems caused due to undesirable appropriation of technology, as has been
									evidenced

									without any testing, and has similarly been noticed in another technology-driven
									initiatives like Aadhaar in their assumed validity without adequate testing. </p>

									National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is an initiative of the Government of India to
									make
									all government services available to the citizens of India via electronic media,
									instead
									of them having to fill up paper forms. However, an emphasis on electronic means of
									accessing government services at the cost of not scaling traditional offline
									face-to-face mechanisms, is known to cause problems to the poor because of their
									limited
									technological skills, technology access, and empowerment. Studies have pointed out
									how
									E-governance initiatives have been primarily shaped by the political economy around
									the
									policy, at times leading to its misuse. A study by Benjamin et al found that the
									e-governance project Bhoomi, which digitizes land records around Bangalore in India,
									led
									to corruption and capture of large areas of land by elites with connections to the
									judiciary and administration, aided by the land-records data that became more easily
									accessible for strategic planning by these large players. The authors conclude that
									in
									policies related to E-governance, the outcomes are shaped more by the political
									economy
									around policies rather than the techno-managerial concerns. Veeraraghavan in his
									work
									studied the data management platform built for NREGA, and found that the platform
									originally intended to curtail corruption and bring transparency, ended up mostly
									being
									useful as an accounting and reporting platform but was not able to address
									corruption
									due to new pathways discovered by local officials to bypass technology checks.</p>

									Cashless
									Economy aims to create an economic state where by financial transactions are not
									conducted with money in the form of physical bank notes or coins, but rather through
									the
									transfer of digital information between the transacting parties. Among other
									objectives,
									the demonetization move was positioned as a policy to push India towards a cashless
									state, so that the poor who do not have any credit history or access to banking
									channels, will be able to create this data trail that will help them later get
									easier
									access to formal sources of credit and other financial instruments. Controversy
									however
									prevails, because the low access to digital technology by the poor, trust issues in
									using entirely electronic means for money management, capability and skills at
									technology usage, and event below utilization of bank accounts by the poor, lead to
									arguments about whether the country is even ready for such a move and what kind of
									safeguards in law and skilling should be developed before such policies can be
									pushed.
