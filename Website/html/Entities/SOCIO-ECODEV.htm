					Models for socio-economic development are useful for planners to build appropriate policies. Such
					models are ideally constructed based on empirical data, and we take up the problem of working
					towards a district development model for India by using two waves of census data. India has almost
					six hundred districts, diversely spread apart in terms of both social and economic development, and
					hence presents a unique natural experiment to understand how social and economic factors interplay
					with one another. We present some interesting observations we are able to make from longitudinal
					analysis of census data from the years 2001 and 2011, and raise some questions calling for the need
					for ethnographic and other surveys to be able to understand the underlying mechanisms that would
					lead to the observed patterns. We feel that some of these mechanisms can be captured using data from
					participatory media networks, and propose as part of future work to use this bottom-up data together
					with top-down data from censuses and other sources, to build a comprehensive district development
					model.
					<br><br>
					We divide our findings into 6 Hypotheses that broadly encapsulate our findings. They not only
					highlight the key trends in socio-economic development across the past few years, but also
					illustrate a good method for simplifying complex multi-dimensional data into simple units for making
					comparison.
