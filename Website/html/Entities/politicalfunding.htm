                        Corporations often donate money to political parties. Such donations are sometimes on the rise, especially before elections. Needless to say, such donations also form a major chunk of the interlocks that exist between the corporate and government networks. As an outcome of these donations, companies often receive direct or indirect favours from the political parties as well, in terms of legislations/policies passed in favour of the companies, tax benefits, clearances obtained, and so on. <br>  
			In this page we show the donation received by major Political Parties of India in last ten years followed by amount received by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) the biggest political party of India and Indian National Congress (INC) the oldest political party of India the data is taken from verified sources and shows interesting trends.

					The donations received by the major national political parties in last 10 years.<br> The table has three
					bars referring to BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), INC (Indian National Congress), Rest which includes
					the following parties : CPI,CPI(M),BSP, AITC,NCP.<br> From the figure we can conclude that the donation
					received by the national political parties have been on rise. However the rate with which donations
					has been received by BJP is much higher than rest of the political parties. In Lok Sabha election of
					2009, both BJP and Congress had received almost equal amount. However subsequently in the next years
					till 2017, the amount received by BJP was much more than all other parties.In 2014 Lok Sabha
					Election, there was a massive increase of 5 times the prevous donation amount in 2009 for BJP
					whereas INC got a mere jump of 1.5 times. BJP continued to receive large amount post 2014.Total
					donations received by all political parties from known sources with amount greater than Rs 20,000 in
					year 2017-18 is Rs 469.82 crores as per our calculation which can be verified from <a
						href="https://adrindia.org/content/analysis-donationsreceived-above-rs-20000-national-political-parties-%E2%80%93-fy2017-18">
						Report of

					The comparison betweeen donation received by BJP and INC when they had formed the government at
					centre. Clearly the amount as well number of sectors donating to BJP is far more than that to INC
					when INC was in power. For BJP many new sectors had emerged as major contributors which had not
					donated to INC which indicates that these sectors have been bene?tted by the policies of BJP
					government.<br> These sectors are :
					<br><b>(a)</b> Agriculture and Allied Actvities <br><b>(b)</b> Auto Parts and Equipment<br><b> (c)</b> Electricity,Gas and Water <br><b>(d)</b>
					Finance <br><b>(e)</b> Manufacturing(Food and Stuff) <br><b>(f)</b> Specialtiy Retail <br><b>(g)</b> Transport,Storage and
					Communications
					<br><br>On the other hand companies from following sectors did not donate to BJP while they had donated to
					Congress when Congress was in power at the centre :
					<br><b>(a)</b> Ciggarette and Tobacco Products <br><b>(b)</b> Manufacturing(Textiles) <br><b>(c)</b> Manufacturing(Wood Products)
					Rest of the sectors had donated to both the parties with signi?cant increase in donation to BJP by
					business services sector and significant reduction in donation to BJP by Manufacturing(Machinery and
					Equipment).
