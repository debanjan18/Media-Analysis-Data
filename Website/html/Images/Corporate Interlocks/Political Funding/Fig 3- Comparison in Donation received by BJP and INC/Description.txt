Clearly the amount as well number of sectors donating to BJP is far more than that to INC when INC was in power. For BJP many new sectors had emerged as major contributors which had not donated to INC which indicates that these sectors have been bene?tted by the policies of BJP government. These sectors are : 
(a) Agriculture and Allied Actvities (b) Auto Parts and Equipment (c) Electricity,Gas and Water (d) Finance (e) Manufacturing(Food and Stu?) (f) Specialtiy Retail (g) Transport,Storage and Communications
On the other hand companies from following sectors did not donate to BJP while they had donated to Congress when Congress was in power at the centre :
(a) Ciggarette and Tobacco Products (b) Manufacturing(Textiles) (c) Manufacturing(Wood Products)
Rest of the sectors had donated to both the parties with signi?cant increase in donation to BJP by business services sector and signi?cant reduction in donation to BJP by Manufacturing(Machinery and Equipment).
