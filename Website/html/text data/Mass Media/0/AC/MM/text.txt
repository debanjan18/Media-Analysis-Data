<b>Aspect Coverage of Aadhar in Mass Media by news sources</b><br><br> 

The highest covered aspect in Aadhaar by mass media talks about the court cases related to the policy – primarily on data security, right to privacy, and linking of Aadhaar to welfare schemes. This aspect discusses about the court cases on whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right, and the issues on leakage of citizens’ data due to lack of planning and professionalism of the agencies appointed by the government to collect this data. The articles in this aspect directly mention the middle-class citizens being one of the most affected constituencies.

In mass media, the focus in Aadhaar is thus more on informing the middle-class citizens about the facilities for connecting them to the policy, the operations around policy implementation, and loopholes related to privacy of data. There is a conspicuous lack of attention to the issues impacting the poor directly. Thus, although Aadhaar is not an issue as highly politicized as demonetization, it does not see sufficient representation or a detailed study of the issues of the poor by the mass media.
