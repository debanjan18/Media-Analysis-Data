<b>Aspect Coverage of Demonetisation in Mass Media by news sources</b><br><br> 

The highest covered aspect in the mass media talks about the prime minister’s statements on the policy, and his encouragement to the general public and the poor to support the policy move to fight black money and corruption. In this aspect, the articles cover the prime minister’s expression of gratitude towards the poor and middle-class people for bearing the troubles post its implementation, and the benefits the policy would bring, like curbing the problems of black money, corruption, and terror funding, which would lead to benefit of the people in the long term, thus justifying the government narrative behind the policy.<br> The second highest covered aspect covers the opposition’s comments and protests against demonetization and the government narrative around it, and the prime minister’s statements against the opposition for denouncing the move, calling the opposition parties anti-poor and anti-common man. This aspect includes articles that primarily discuss the political debates around the move, and how it would benefit the ruling party in garnering votes in the upcoming election. The articles in this aspect revolve around the political blame games across prominent politicians, without much discussion of the actual issues related to these constituencies.

Since demonetization was a highly politicized issue, the mass media generally covers mostly the politics involved, and covers the state’s narrative in support of the policy and the arguments arising from the opposition thereof. Thus, the reference to the poor and the middle class in mass media is only incidental, because the politicization of the issue included narratives and counter narratives built around these two classes.
