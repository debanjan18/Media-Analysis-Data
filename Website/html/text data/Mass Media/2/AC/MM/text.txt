<b>Aspect Coverage of GST in Mass Media by news sources</b><br><br> 
<br>
In GST the top aspect covered in mass media includes [discussions on the troubles faced by small traders to meet the GST registration deadline]. This aspect directly relates to the trouble that the small traders and businesses faced across the country, in registering for GST due to impending registration deadlines and faults in the GST registration software, and does not include discussions around the issues of the consumers.<br>
Examples of issues related to consumers include rise in price of commodities and services because of more of them coming under the tax umbrella due to a push towards formalization, leading to informal enterprises dying out and making way for formal enterprises. <br>
The second highest covered aspect in mass media discusses the [implementation of the GST bill in different states], with significant amount of discussion revolving around the applicability of GST in Jammu and Kashmir, a state granted special status. This aspect does not relate to the issues of the middle class and the poor directly.
<br>
<br>For GST, the primary focus of the media is thus on the troubles faced by traders in registering for GST. The issues relevant to the consumers see a clear deficiency in attention.
